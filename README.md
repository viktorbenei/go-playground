go-playground
=============

A Playground project, for playing with Go


# Run test in a folder:

    $ (cd mclass && go test)

# Manage dependencies - with "versioning"

Official recommendation: copy the dependency sources into your repository. This will guarantee that the source you use in your project will be the same everywhere you use it.

Tools:

* Officially recommended tool: goven [https://github.com/kr/goven](https://github.com/kr/goven). It's also a very simple one, 1 go file.
* A more complex tool, started by the same guy (kr): [https://github.com/tools/godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) -> can update dependencies
